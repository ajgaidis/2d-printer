# 2d-printer

### Demo Movies

Please check out the demo movies I included in this directory. They show the printer at work drawing circles and an impossible triangle. I also included a video of some of the laser cutting work I did because I think it is so darn cool.


### Hardware Overview

The printer is constructed with metal beams, acrylic (laser-cut) gantries, NEMA 17 stepper motors, 1 lead screw, 2 belts, 1 controller (essentially an Arduino Mega), and 1 24V power supply. The website for this project gives a more exact breakdown of parts and how the hardware all came together.

Constructing this printer was definitely the most challenging part of this project. Having to model things in CAD, make sure measurements were accurate down to the millimeter, choose the right parts, and so much more contributed to this not being an easy task; the planning and construction was definitely the most time consuming part.

The hardware provides three axis of motion (x, y, z) that allow a pen to draw on a roughly 2x3inch acrylic platform. In the future, I plan on turning this acryllic platform into a heated bed and swapping out the pen for an extruder to make a 3-D printer out of the 2-D printer.


### Code Overview

##### Controlling the Stepper Motors

To control the stepper motors, I mapped the motor leads to the corresponding pins on my controller by reading the spec sheet... there were a LOT of pins to map.
From there, I used a library called AccelStepper and MultiStepper that tuned the current each motor needed and allowed me to run the motors in parallel to enable diagonal movement in addition to the standard linear motion in the {x,y,z}-axis directions.

In essence, what the stepper motor code provides is an abstraction of the drawing surface as an x-y cartesian plane with movement in the z-direction for raising and lowering the pen.

##### Drawing

One layer of abstraction up from the stepper motor control, I made classes that define things one can draw through manipulation of the motors, such as Point, Line, and Circle.

Point is simply an (x, y, z) coordinate pair, but it has some special functions that allow someone to visit that point with the pen raised (z-axis manipulation)or lowered.

Line is defined by two points. A user can either give both points when constructing a line, or, they  can give a point, a length, and an angle in radians.  In this second case, the constructor of Line will create a second point based on these arguments. Of course Line wouldn't be complete without a draw function :).

Circle is defined by a radius which is used in the equation r**2 = x**2 + y**2 which represents the circle. When someone calls `drawCircle()` the current (x, y)values become the circle center and we begin drawing the circle by giving an x value (which starts at r) solving for y, incrementing x, solving for y, and so on connecting each of the generated points with a line until a full circle is formed. Thus, we get a pretty good approximation of a circle. This can be seen in the video that is included with this submission.


### Running the Code

Running the code is as simply as uploading the Arduino sketch to the controller. Nothing else fancy is involved. Of course, the AccelStepper and MultiStepper libraries need to be installed for this to work, but that is the only caveat.


### Testing Results

Testing results of the build were positive. I drew a series of cool lines, an impossible triangle, and a series of circles. 


### Bugs

There are no known bugs in the software. There are no "bugs" in the hardware either, however, in the future I would like to dampen some of the vibration from the motors which can be reflected in the lines that are drawn.
